## Privacy Statement

JNCC is the public body that advises the UK Government and devolved administrations on UK-wide and international nature conservation.

Purpose
This privacy notice tells you what to expect when the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) collects and uses personal information for the Air Polution Assessment system. JNCC (as data controller) will only be collecting personal data for the Alpha and Beta phases of the Air Polution Assessment  system.

Information we collect
We may collect the following information:

User registration details (email address)
Email address to allow the sending of a report download link
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
Information on how visitors use the site, using cookies and page tagging techniques
For the live phase of the AERIUS system, a new data controller will be appointed. At the bottom of this privacy statement, you will find our contact details if you require any further information.

Please note: If you go to another website from this one, read the privacy notice on that website to find out how it may use your information.

How we use your information
User registration: The current Alpha and Beta versions of the system requires users to access the system through a restricted (authorisation-only) log-in mechanism. A user requiring access needs to request access to the software from the project team, by providing the email address they would like to use as their username, the software development team. A user account will then be created, and the user will be instructed to log in and create a password.

The registered user details for the Alpha and Beta versions will be deleted when the system moves into the live phase and the user registration system is removed.

Requesting a report document download: The system requires a user to enter an email address, to allow the results of their assessment to be emailed to them (as a PDF or GML file) once processing has been completed. This email address is captured as part of the public task in completing an air pollution assessment. The email address for data download will only remain resident in the AERIUS system until the email (with a link to the results file) has been sent. It will then be deleted.

Cookies: When you provide your consent, we use Google Analytics cookies to collect information about how you use GOV.UK. You can read more about how we use cookies on our Cookies webpage.

Website performance: We store and process your IP address when you use our system for performance and security purposes in line with our public task and legitimate interests. We will only store IP addresses for 6 months, after which time they are deleted.
