# Data Licenses
A number of data licenses are held in the tool, this includes the following: 

- Land cover map under the Non-Commercial Government Licence. Data owned by UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology© Database Right/Copyright UKCEH;
- OS terrain 50 data under OS open data
- Calculator for Road Emissions of Ammonia (CREAM v2) owned and provided by Air Quality Consultants (AQC) Ltd
- The Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS) – Urban used in the service has a specific licence agreement with its owners CERC Ltd. that authorises its use within the service. Users can only access the modelling capability through the UKAPAS Calculator user interface
- The meteorological data is used in calculations within the service and all outputs from those calculations are free to use and distribute but resale or distribution of the data in original form is not permitted 

In addition, the service uses the following data sets under [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/1/open-government-licence.htm) (OGL) sharing agreements and is subject to [Crown copyright protection](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/crown-copyright/) , this is highlighted in the [terms and conditions](3-terms-and-conditions.md) and includes:

-	Northern Ireland specific emission factors for poultry and cattle source
-	UK agricultural emission factors
-	Nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) background maps (including Scotland’s NOx background map)
-	Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) background concentration and Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) for Ammonia and Nitrogen
-	Road emissions of (NO<sub>x</sub>), the Emission Factors Toolkit
-	Road traffic estimates diurnal profiles
