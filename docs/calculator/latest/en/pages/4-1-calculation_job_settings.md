# Calculation Job Settings

## Scenario overview

The scenario overview shows all of the scenarios you've uploaded, as well as some summary information, such as the:
- calculation year
- number of emission sources
- emissions for oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) in kilograms per year
  
Scenarios that are included in the current calculation job are shown with a blue bar on the left.

The calculation method you select determines the area and points for which results will be calculated.

## Calculation job

A calculation job is a group of scenarios that will be calculated together as a set. Each calculation job requires at least 1 scenario.

#### Calculation job type

- **process contribution** - a project scenario is calculated, optionally in combination with a reference and/or an off site reduction scenario
- **maximum temporary effect** - the maximum of one or more temporary scenarios is calculated, optionally in combination with a reference and/or an off site reduction scenario
- **in-combination process contribution** - a project scenario is calculated together with 1 or more in combination scenarios, optionally in combination with a reference and/or an off site reduction scenario
- **single scenario** - the contribution of one scenario is calculated

**Please note: In-combination assessments are only valid at the time of calculation and maybe subject to change**

#### Calculation method

- **quick run** - you can use this method to quickly calculate an indicative set of results, using only a small proportion of the meteorological dataset. This method is recommended to be used in for informal modelling such as indicative testing or when learning to use the tool. 

- **formal assessment** - you can use this calculation method as part of the formal permit or planning process. Results are calculated for the extents of each designated site located within 15 km of the emission sources. As a future feature, it will be possible to define different default calculation settings depending on the Area (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales).

- **custom assessment points** - this method will calculate results only for the individual assessment points defined using the 'Assessment points' screen. It will not calculate results for the full extents of all designated sites located within a certain distance of the emission sources. Additionally, this calculation method does not provide information on Decision Making Threshold (DMT) as an automated search for designated site is excluded. To obtain results across the extents of nearby designated sites as well as at individual assessment points, you need to run the calculation twice using different calculation methods (i.e. the custom assessment points method as well as one of the other options). This calculation method can also be useful for running a fast calculation, using only a few custom assessment points, and sense-checking that the results are generally as expected.

#### Other Calculation job settings

Other settings within this tab allow you to select the country, project category (agriculture, combustion plant, roads, other) and zone influence. Please enter the relevant information for your calculation. Additionally, the reference scenario, project scenario and off-site reduction scenario allows you to select any loaded scenarios to be considered as part of the calculation.
