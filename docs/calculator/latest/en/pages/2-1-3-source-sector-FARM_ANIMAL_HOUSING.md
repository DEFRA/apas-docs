## Emission Source: Animal Housing

Animal housing sources are broken down into subsources. 

By inputting the relevant information under 'default emissions' (e.g. the number of animals and the housing technique), the emission rates of NH<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> can be estimated using emission factors.

The default emission factors used in this service are from the [Simple Calculation of Atmospheric Impact Limits (SCAIL)](https://www.scail.ceh.ac.uk/). You can enter your own emission factors using the 'custom specification' option.
