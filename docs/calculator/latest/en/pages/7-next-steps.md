# Next steps

You can use the results from the service to inform your air pollution assessment report for submission to the regulator or to ecological specialists for interpretation.

You should also use the report export option to export a file which will contain all of your model settings and results. You should share this file with the regulator alongside your standard air pollution assessment report.
