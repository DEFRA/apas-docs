## Emission Source: Agriculture

The agriculture sector includes the following options for emission sources:
- [animal housing emissions](2-1-3-source-sector-FARM_ANIMAL_HOUSING.md)
- [Litter/manure storage](2-1-3-source-sector-MANURE_STORAGE.md)
- [farmland](2-1-3-source-sector-FARMLAND.md)
- [greenhouse horticulture](2-1-3-source-sector-GENERIC.md)
- [other](2-1-3-source-sector-GENERIC.md)

The farmland option is further broken down into:
- farmland grazing
- Organic fertiliser application 
- Inorganic fertiliser application
- organic processes
- outdoor yards

### Source characteristics

Use the source characteristics panel to enter information about the emission source, such as the height and temperature.

By default, the temperature and density of emissions are assumed to match ambient conditions, but the density or temperature can be specified if desired.

### Additional characteristics

Below the source characteristics panel will be additional panels that are relevant to the chosen emission source. For the housing emissions, manure storage and farmland options, sources are subdivided into subsources and can be calculated using default emission factors from the [Simple Calculation of Atmospheric Impact Limits (SCAIL)](https://www.scail.ceh.ac.uk/). There are additional Northern Ireland-specific emission factors indicated with a 'Northern Ireland' label. You can also enter your own emission factors using the 'custom specification' option (available under housing and manure storage) or by selecting the 'other' sector.
