# Export

You have 3 options for exporting your results:
- **Input files:** - export a Geography Markup Language (GML) file containing all the information entered in the 'Input' section, such as emission sources and buildings.
- **Calculation job:** - export a GML file containing all inputs, calculation settings and results associated with a single calculation job, including met data details. Use the 'Choose calculation job' dropdown to specify whether you would like to export a file based on a specific calculation job.
- **Report** - export a report in PDF format for either process contribution or in-combination results, using the 'Report type' dropdown.

When exporting a file, you must provide your email address. This is only used to send you a link to download your file when it is ready and will not be kept for anything else.

Your can also download files directly by using the download link shown in the message centre when the files are ready.

For calculations that are expected to take a while to run, or which will be assessed using external tools, you can use the 'Export Calculation job' option to start a calculation and create an exported GML file in one step. You can then exit the service. You will be notified by email when the calculation job is complete and the results can be downloaded. When using this option, the results can be viewed in external tools, such as QGIS.
