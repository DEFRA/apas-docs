## Habitat and species

You can use this tab to view a more detailed breakdown of the individual features (habitats and species) within each site, including information about the CL applicable to each feature and a comparison of the calculation results with the CL. Use the drop down menu to compare against different results. 

The nitrogen sensitivity of each of the habitats and species on the map can be viewed on the map. Here, the lower critical load (Kg/N/Ha/y) habitat/species are shown in a light pink whilst the higher critical load (Kg/N/Ha/y) are shown in dark blue. A legend is available in the map layer under 'Nitrogen-sensitivity relevant habitats and species.
