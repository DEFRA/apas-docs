# Habitat and species

See the [results](5-results.md) page of the guide for an overview of the results tab.

You can use this tab to view a more detailed breakdown of the individual features (habitats and species) within each site, including information about the critical level or critical load (CL) applicable to each feature. Use the drop-down menu to compare the CL against different results. 

The nitrogen sensitivity of each of the habitats and species is also displayed on the map. A legend is available in the map layer menu under 'Nitrogen-sensitivity relevant habitats and species'.

Not all designated sites have been assigned nitrogen sensitive habitats or species and not all habitats and species have assigned CL values. If you are unsure about whether a site is nitrogen sensitive or not or unsure about the CL assigned to a site, contact the statutory nature body relevant to that site for site-specific advice.
