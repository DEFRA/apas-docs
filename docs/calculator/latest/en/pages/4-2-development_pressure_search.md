# Development Pressure Search

Select the emission sources you would like in the development pressure search by clicking on the source names to include/exclude them, this is also visible on the map. You must select at least one source and should include the main sources for your project.

The development pressure search will identify projects in the in-combination archive within 5 km of the sources selected here. That search is used to determine the development pressure class.
