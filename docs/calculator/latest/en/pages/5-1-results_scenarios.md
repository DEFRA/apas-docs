# Scenarios

This tab shows a list of the scenarios included in the current calculation job separated into the user scenarios and, if included, projects from the archive. If your calculation job includes decision framework calculations, the archive scenarios will be separated into those included in the development pressure search (indicated with purple markers on the map) and those included in the in-combination assessment (indicated with orange markers on the map).

*Note that in-combination assessments are only valid at the time of calculation and may be subject to change.*
