## Scenarios

On the 'Scenarios' tab, you can view a list of the scenarios included in the current calculation job and which version of the tool it was carried out in. The list of scenarios includes your scenarios and any pulled from the archive in an in-combination assessment.

**Note that in-combination assessments are only valid at the time of calculation and may be subject to change**
