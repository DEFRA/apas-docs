### Percentage critical load or critical level (%CL)

You can use this tab to compare the process contribution (PC) or the In-combination Process Contribution (IPC) to the critical level (for NO<sub>x</sub> or NH<sub>3</sub> concentrations) or critical load (for nitrogen deposition) of the most sensitive habitat feature associated with each site.

Results for each designated site are colour-coded on the map and summarised in a bar graph. Clicking on one or more colours on the bar graph will select and deselect the hexagons within these ranges on the map, making it easier to focus on specific result values and to distinguish between similar colours on the map.

The PC or IPC is expressed as a percentage of the applicable critical level or critical load. This determines the main colour of the result, meaning either the colour of the hexagon for deposition or the colour of the dot for concentration.

The total predicted environmental concentration (PEC) or deposition level is also calculated for each hexagon or point, by adding the PC or IPC to the background pollution levels. The total is shown as a:
- dark grey circle within the hexagon or a dark grey ring around the point if the total exceeds the minimum critical load or critical level of the site
- light grey circle within the hexagon or a light grey ring around the point if the total does not exceed the minimum critical load or critical level, but is close to exceeding it (between 80-100%)

When viewing the %CL results on a map, it is possible to view both:
- the contribution of the plan or project in isolation (PC) or in combination (IPC) as a percentage of the CL.
- the total predicted concentration or deposition (PC + background levels, or IPC + background levels) as a percentage of the CL.

The colours of the results, and the value categories on the x-axis of the bar graphs, change depending on whether you are viewing results for PC or IPC. The change in x-axis values recognises that different values of %CL may be considered acceptable depending on whether you are viewing results for an in-isolation assessment (PC results) or an in-combination assessment (IPC results).
