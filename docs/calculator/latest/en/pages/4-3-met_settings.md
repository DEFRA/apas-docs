# Meteorological Settings

You can select the appropriate meteorological site and year from the dropdown menus. Two types of meteorological data can be used:
- **Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)** - computer-modelled meterological data 
- **observational** - measured meteorological data from specific sites

When running five years of met data, the calculator will determine the maximum value for each hexagon within those five years and present that as the scenario result.
