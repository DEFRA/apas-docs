## What the service does

The 'Get an air pollution assessment' service calculates the air quality impacts of building new developments near sensitive ecological sites. You can use the information created by the service when applying for an environmental permit or planning permission.

The service uses computer models to calculate the air pollutant emissions from new developments, as well as the resulting air pollutant concentrations and deposition levels at relevant nearby sites. For example, you could use the service to calculate:
- the air quality impacts of the traffic associated with a new residential development
- the difference between existing farm operations and those associated with a planned expansion or renovation

The service combines data from:
- Defra's Emission Factor Toolkit (EFT) (v11.0)
- Simple Calculation of Atmospheric Impact Limits (SCAIL)
- background concentrations of pollutants from Defra's background maps
- dispersion modelling results from ADMS Urban
- average deposition velocities (which are based on the values for tall and short vegetation recommended by the Air Quality Technical Advisory Group (AQTAG)).

## Start

From the Home screen, you can select whether you want to start by creating a new scenario or importing existing files.

### Create a new scenario

Click the button that says 'create a new scenario'. This enables a new scenario to be created manually. 

### Import existing files
To import an existing file, drag the required file into the box or click browse.
You can import the following file types:
- .gml (Geography Markup Language)
- .pdf
- .zip
- .rcp

If you wish to import files from an existing model (e.g. ADMS), there are 2 options available:
- basic
- advanced.

**Basic import mode**

This mode allows you to upload individual files that contain information about a single scenario.

This is the default mode when you use the service for the first time. When you upload a file it will appear as a new line. You can then click the arrow to the left of the file name to see the file details, such as the number of emission sources or buildings.

**Advanced import mode**

This mode allows you to upload files that contain multiple scenarios. It also allows you to specify what to do with files while they are being imported, such as updating or combining files from previous calculations.

You can select the Advanced import mode option in Preferences. When you upload a new file, each scenario will appear as a separate line, even if multiple scenarios are contained within the original file.

You can choose how to use each scenario. The options are:
- import it as a new scenario
- add it to an existing scenario that has already been created or imported
- merge it with another scenario that is being imported at the same time
- ignore the scenario
- specify the scenario type

You can choose to include or exclude specific components of each scenario (for example, emission sources, buildings, calculation jobs and assessment points). You can do this by ticking or unticking the corresponding boxes.
