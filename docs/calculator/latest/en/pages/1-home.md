## What the service does

The 'Get an air pollution assessment' service calculates the air quality impacts of building new developments near sensitive ecological sites. You can use the information created by the service when applying for an environmental permit or planning permission.

The service uses computer models (ADMS-Urban) to calculate the air pollutant emissions from new developments, as well as the resulting air pollutant concentrations and deposition levels at relevant nearby sites. For example, you could use the service to calculate:
- the air quality impacts of the traffic associated with a new residential development
- the difference between existing farm operations and those associated with a planned expansion or renovation

For more information on the data used in the tool, please see the [Data Licenses](../content/data-license.md) page.

## How to use this guide

If you are new to the 'Get an air pollution assessment' service, we recommend leaving this guide open as you work through your first assessment. The page shown here will change to match the tab you are using as you move through the service. You can also use the table of contents to choose which page to view.

## Start

From the Home screen, you can select whether you want to start by creating a new scenario or importing existing files.

<div id='section3a'></div>

### Create a new scenario

Click the 'create a new scenario' button. This enables a new scenario to be entered manually. 

<div id='section3b'></div>

### Import existing files
To import an existing file, drag the required file into the box or click browse.
You can import the following file types:
- .gml (Geography Markup Language)
- .pdf
- .zip
- .upl

There are two import options available:
- basic
- advanced

#### Basic import mode

This mode allows you to upload individual files that contain information about one or more scenarios.

This is the default mode when you use the service for the first time. When you upload a file, it will appear as a new line. You can then click the arrow to the left of the file name to see the file details, such as the number of emission sources or buildings.

#### Advanced import mode

This mode allows you to specify what to do with each scenario as they are imported, such as excluding or combining files from previous calculations.

You can select the Advanced import mode option in Preferences. When you upload a new file, each scenario will appear as a separate line, even if multiple scenarios are contained within the original file.

You can choose how to use each scenario. The options are:
- import it as a new scenario
- add it to an existing scenario that has already been created or imported
- merge it with another scenario that is being imported at the same time
- ignore the scenario
- specify the scenario type

You can choose to include or exclude specific components of each scenario (for example, emission sources, buildings, calculation jobs and assessment points). You can do this by ticking or unticking the corresponding boxes.
