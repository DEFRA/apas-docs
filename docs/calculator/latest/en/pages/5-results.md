The progress indicator shows how far the modelling calculation has progressed, where you are in the queue and the estimated time to completion. The message centre will show when the calculation has started and is complete.

You can switch between different calculation jobs using the drop down menu at the top left of the Results screen. 

You can end the calculation with the 'Cancel calculation' button.

## Results

Use the 'Scenario' dropdown to select the scenario you want to view results for.

Use the 'Result' dropdown to select the type of result you want to see:
- 'Scenario contribution' (SC) shows the calculation results for the selected scenario on its own - this type of result is available for all scenario types
- 'Process contribution' (PC) allows you to visualise the pollutant contribution associated with your plan or project, as a standalone or in-isolation assessment - it is calculated as:

  > PC = (project scenario results) – (reference scenario results) – (off-site reduction results)

  If there is no Reference scenario or off-site reduction scenario included in the calculation, then the process contribution is simply equal to the scenario contribution. This type of result is only available for Project-type scenarios.
  
- 'In combination' (IC) shows the total of the process contribution and any in-combination scenarios added
- 'Archive contribution' shows the contribution only from the archive scenarios added

Use 'Pollutant' to select whether to view results for oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) concentration, ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) concentration or nitrogen deposition.

## View

Use the 'View' dropdown to select whether you want to view results for the fixed assessment grid or custom assessment points.

You can use the tabs below the white box to present results in different ways. When you select a tab, the data on the map will update with it.

Results for nitrogen deposition are shown as mapped hexagons. Each hexagon measures approximately 250m from point to point. Deposition results are based on the average NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> concentration in the hexagon (based on all of the concentration results within the hexagon), multiplied by a deposition velocity and conversion factor to determine deposition. An average deposition velocity for each hexagon has been calculated based on a land use map and the deposition velocities for tall and short vegetation recommended by the Air Quality Technical Advisory Group (AQTAG).

Results for NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> concentration are shown as points on the map. The number of points calculated per hexagon depends on how close that hexagon is to emission sources. Hexagons closer to the emission source will have a higher resolution of points.

### Percentage critical load or critical level (%CL) tab

You can use this tab to compare the process contribution (PC) or the In-combination Process Contribution (IPC) to the critical level (for NO<sub>x</sub> or NH<sub>3</sub> concentrations) or critical load (for nitrogen deposition) of the most sensitive habitat feature associated with each site.

Results for each designated site are colour-coded on the map and summarised in a bar graph. Clicking on one or more colours on the bar graph will select and deselect the same colours on the map, making it easier to focus on specific result values and to distinguish between similar colours on the map.

The PC or IPC is expressed as a percentage of the applicable critical level or critical load. This determines the main colour of the result, meaning either the colour of the hexagon for deposition or the colour of the dot for concentration.

The total predicted environmental concentration (PEC) or deposition level is also calculated for each hexagon or point, by adding the PC or IPC to the background pollution levels. The total is shown as a:
- dark grey circle within the hexagon or a dark grey ring around the point if the total exceeds the minimum critical load or critical level of the site
- light grey circle within the hexagon or a light grey ring around the point if the totl does not exceed the minimum critical load or critical level, but is close to exceeding it (between 80-100%)

When viewing the %CL results on a map, it is possible to view both:
- the contribution of the plan or project in isolation (PC) or in combination (IPC) as a percentage of the CL
- the total predicted concentration or deposition (PC + background levels, or IPC + background levels) as a percentage of the CL

The colours of the results, and the value categories on the x-axis of the bar graphs, change depending on whether you are viewing results for PC or IPC. The change in x-axis values recognises that different values of %CL may be considered acceptable depending on whether you are viewing results for an in-isolation assessment (PC results) or an in-combination assessment (IPC results).

### Distribution tab

You can use this tab to view the calculation results:
- units of concentration (μg/m<sup>3</sup>) for NO<sub>x</sub> or NH<sub>3</sub>
- units of deposition (kg N /ha/y) for nitrogen

As with the %CL tab, for each designated site results are colour-coded, visible on the map and summarised in a bar graph.

<div id='section4c'></div>

### Markers tab

You can use this tab to identify areas with key results for each designated site. For example, the area of the designated sites with the largest increase or decrease in pollution levels.

<div id='section4d'></div>

### Habitat and species tab

You can use this tab to view a more detailed breakdown of the individual features (habitats and species) within each site, including information about the CL applicable to each feature and a comparison of the calculation results with the CL.
