The progress bar shows the modelling calculation progress, where you are in the queue and the estimated time to completion. The message centre will show when the calculation has started and is complete.

You can switch between different calculation jobs using the drop down menu at the top left of the Results screen. 

You can end the calculation with the 'Cancel calculation' button.

## Results

Use the 'Scenario' dropdown to select the scenario you want to view results for.

Use the 'Result' dropdown to select the type of result you want to see:
- 'Scenario contribution' (SC) shows the calculation results for the selected scenario on its own - this type of result is available for all scenario types
- 'Process contribution' (PC) allows you to visualise the pollutant contribution associated with your plan or project, as a standalone or in-isolation assessment - it is calculated as:

  > PC = (project scenario results) – (reference scenario results) – (off-site reduction results)

  If there is no Reference scenario or off-site reduction scenario included in the calculation, then the process contribution is simply equal to the scenario contribution. This type of result is only available for Project-type scenarios.
  
- 'In combination' (IPC) shows the total of the process contribution and any in-combination scenarios added
- 'Archive contribution' shows the contribution only from the archive scenarios added

Use 'Pollutant' to select whether to view results for oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) concentration, ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) concentration or nitrogen deposition.

The results tab has four sub-tabs that show additional information on the map and in the results panel:
- [Distribution](5-3-2-results_distribution.md)
- [Percentage critical load or critical level (%CL)](5-3-1-results_cl.md)
- [Markers](5-3-3-results_markers.md)
- [Habitat and species](5-3-4-results_habitat_and_species.md)

## View

Use the 'View' dropdown to select whether you want to view results for the fixed assessment grid or custom assessment points.

You can use the tabs below the white box to present results in different ways. When you select a tab, the data on the map will update with it.

Results for nitrogen deposition are shown as mapped hexagons. Each hexagon measures approximately 250m from point to point. Deposition results are based on the average NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> concentration in the hexagon (based on all of the concentration results within the hexagon), multiplied by a deposition velocity and conversion factor to determine deposition. An average deposition velocity for each hexagon has been calculated based on a land use map.

Results for NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> concentration are shown as points on the map. The number of points calculated per hexagon depends on how close that hexagon is to emission sources. Hexagons closer to the emission source will have a higher resolution of points.
