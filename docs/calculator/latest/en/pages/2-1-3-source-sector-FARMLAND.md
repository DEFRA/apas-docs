## Emission source: Farmland

The Farmland sector is broken down into:
- farmland grazing
- organic fertiliser application
- inorganic fertiliser application
- organic processes
- outdoor yards

Farmland sources are broken down into subsources. Farmland grazing, manure application (animal) and outdoor yards use emission factors from the Simple Calculation of Atmospheric Impact Limits (SCAIL). If you don't want to use emission factors, select the 'Fireplaces, other' sector where the emissions can be inputted manually. 

Manure application (fertilizer) and organic processes require the manual input of NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions in kilograms per year.
