## Emission source: Farmland

The farmland sector is broken down into:
- farmland grazing
- organic fertiliser application
- inorganic fertiliser application
- organic processes
- outdoor yards

Farmland sources are broken down into subsources. Farmland grazing, organic fertiliser application and outdoor yards use emission factors from the [Simple Calculation of Atmospheric Impact Limits (SCAIL)](https://www.scail.ceh.ac.uk/). If you don't want to use emission factors, select the 'Other' sector which allows for the manual input of emissions. 

Organic fertiliser application and organic processes do not have emission factors and require the manual input of NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions in kilograms per year.
