# Buildings

You can add new buildings by drawing the outline on the map or specifying the coordinates as a Well-Known Text (WKT) string. You can then enter the height of the building. You can specify rectangular and circular buildings. When drawing the building, double click to finish drawing.

To include the impact of building influence in the calculation, tick 'Building influence' in the source characteristics of the relevant emission source and choose which building to link. This step must be carried out for all sources that may be affected by buildings. If the building is not yet available, you can click on 'Add' to create the building.
