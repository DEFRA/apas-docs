# Decision Framework 

The decision framework tab allows suggestions of if your scenario meets any decision-making thresholds or site-relevant thresholds.  

The decision-making thresholds section states the process contribution (PC) and the decision-making thresholds (DMT), which is dependent on the habitat type. These values are then used in the following equation to give the percentage comparison with threshold (%CT).  This can be viewed for nitrogen deposition, NO<sub>x</sub> concentration and NH<sub>3</sub> concentration.  

> %CT = PC/DMT x100
 
 

A %CT value of larger than 100% suggests your process contribution result requires further assessment, this can be viewed in the in the site-relevant section threshold. The site-relevant threshold section breaks down the %CT by assessment point allowing you to view if any specific sites reach the site-relevant threshold.  

For specific advice about the proposal please refer to guidance from your relevant regulatory body.
