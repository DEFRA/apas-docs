# Decision Framework 

This tab shows if your scenario exceeds any decision-making thresholds or site-relevant thresholds.
The decision-making thresholds section compares the process contribution (PC) and the decision-making thresholds (DMT). The DMT value is dependent on the habitat type for ammonia and independent of habitat type for Nitrogen Deposition and nitrogen oxides. These values are then used in the following equation to give the percentage comparison with the threshold :
> Percentage Threshold Comparison = PC/DMT x 100

A Percentage Threshold Comparison value of larger than 100% indicates your process contribution result is greater than the DMT or site-relevant threshold (SRT) and requires further assessment. Additionally, a yellow box with text outlines need for more assessment and a yellow triangle shows on specific site dropdowns. Where the Percentage Thresholds Comparison shows that the PC is below the DMT or SRT, a green box outlines that there is no need for further in-combination assessment and the user can download a PDF to use as evidence for the decision maker.  

The site-relevant threshold section compares the PC to the SRT, which depends on the development pressure class   and is assessed for each designated site separately. Development pressure is automatically determined by counting the number of below DMT or SRT proposals within the In-combination Archive.

For specific advice about the proposal please refer to guidance from your relevant regulatory body.
