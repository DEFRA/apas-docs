# Decision Framework 

This tab shows if your scenario exceeds any decision-making thresholds or site-relevant thresholds.  

The decision-making thresholds section compares the process contribution (PC) and the decision-making thresholds (DMT). The DMT value is dependent on the habitat type. These values are then used in the following equation to give the percentage comparison with the threshold (%CT):

> %CT = PC/DMT x 100

A %CT value of larger than 100% indicates your process contribution result requires further assessment, this can be viewed in the in the site-relevant threshold (SRT) section. The site-relevant threshold section compares the PC to the SRT, which depends on the development pressure class and the habitat type, and is assessed for each designated site separately.

For specific advice about the proposal please refer to guidance from your relevant regulatory body.
