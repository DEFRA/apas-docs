# Markers

See the [results](5-results.md) page of the guide for an overview of the results tab.

You can use this tab to identify areas with key results for each designated site:
- Maximum predicted environmental concentration (PEC) or deposition
- Maximum percentage critical level or critical load (%CL)
- Maximum increase in concentration or deposition for that pollutant
- Maximum decrease in concentration or deposition for that pollutant

These markers are additionally identified spatially on the map.
