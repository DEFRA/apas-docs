# Emission Source: Traffic

## Road barriers

Use the source characteristics panel to enter information about barriers which could affect the spread of pollution away from roads, such as noise barriers, buildings, vegetation or tree belts. These are often known as 'street canyon effects.' The barriers on the left and right sides of the road are specified separately. The left and right sides are based on direction of travel from point A to point B on the road link as seen on the map. Suggested default porosity values are provided based on the type of road barrier but you can enter custom values. 

## Emission factors

Within the 'Traffic direction speed and emission' tab you may add a new subsource which calculates oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) emissions based on the number, type and speed of vehicles on the road link. Alternatively, you can enter your own emission factors using the 'custom specification' option.

## Time-varying profiles

Predefined diurnal time-varying profiles have been calculated for road transport emission sources using statistics from the Department for Transport. Default diurnal time-varying profiles are assigned based on the scenario year, with all projects occurring after 2022 assigned the profile for 2022. All projects are assigned a continuous monthly time-varying profile by default. 

To show the list of predefined profiles and the option for creating a new profile, click the arrow next to 'Time-varying profiles'. You can click or hover over one of the predefined profiles to view the details. To create a new profile, choose 'Add new...' under the list of predefined profiles.
