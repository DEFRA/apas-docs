## Emission Source: Traffic

### Source characteristics

The 'Source characteristics' section allows you to enter information about barriers which could affect the spread of pollution away from roads, such as noise barriers, buildings or vegetation and tree belts. These are often known as 'street canyon effects.' The barriers on the left and right sides of the road are specified separately. The left and right sides are based on direction of travel from point A to point B on the road link as seen on the map. Suggested default porosity values are provided based on the type of road barrier but you can enter custom values. 

### Emission factors

Within the 'Traffic direction speed and emission' tab you may add a new subsource which calculates oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) emissions based on the number, type and speed of vehicles on a particular road that you enter. You can also enter your own emission factors using the 'custom specification' option.

### Time-varying profiles

Road transport sources in all years will be assigned a diurnal time-varying profile based on Department for Transport statistics for 2022 and a continuous monthly time-varying profile by default. To show the list of predefined profiles and the option for creating new profile, click the arrow next to 'Time-varying profiles'. You can click or hover over one of the predefined profiles to view the details. To create a new profile, choose 'Add new...' under the list of predefined profiles.
