## Summary

The 'Summary' tab displays a summary of the results of the current calculation job.

### Summary table

You can view tables that provide an overview of the results for all designated sites and scenarios included in a single calculation job. The summary tables can be sorted by clicking on column headings, and you can use the tables to identify which scenarios are predicted to have the largest impact and at which designated sites.

You can also review tables for the results that are typically used in the assessment process that represent the pollutant contribution associated with a plan or project. These are:
- scenario contribution (SC) which shows results for all of the scenarios that were included in the calculation
- process contribution (PC) results which shows the pollutant contribution associated only with the proposed project (i.e. without the background levels, reference scenario or off-site reductions)

The definitions of the column headings are provided below: 
- **Site** - assessment site name
- **Scenario** - name of scenario run to retrieve the results
- **NO<sub>x</sub> max. contribution (µg/m<sup>3</sup>)** - The maximum contribution of NOx within the site listed for the row of the table
- **NH<sub>3</sub> max. contribution (µg/m<sup>3</sup>)** - The maximum contribution of NH3 within the site listed for the row of the table
- **Nitrogen deposition max. contribution (Kg N/ha/y)** - The maximum contribution of nitrogen deposition within the site listed for the row of the table
- **Pollutant** - The pollutant (NH3 concentration, Deposition Nox + NH3 etc.) for the results in that row of the table)
- **Max. increase** - The maximum contribution of the site and pollutant listed for the row of the table
- **Max. %CL (for PC)** - The maximum percentage critical load of the site and pollutant listed for the row of the table (for the process contribution)
- **Highest PEC** - The highest predicted environmental concentration (PEC) for the site and pollutant listed for the row of the table
- **Max. %CL (for total)** - The maximum percentage critical load of the site and pollutant listed for the row of the table (for the total)
