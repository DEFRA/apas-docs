# Emission Source: Energy

## Source characteristics

Use the source characteristics panel to enter information about the emission source, such as the height and temperature.

You can choose to input either the temperature or the density of the emissions, or it can be assumed they match ambient conditions.

## Emissions

For energy emission sources, there are no default emission factors available. Emission rates of NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> must be input manually in kilograms per year (kg/y).
