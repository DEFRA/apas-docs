## Emission Source: Energy

The energy sector includes the following options for emission sources:
- [large combustion plant](2-1-3-source-sector-GENERIC.md)
- [medium combustion plant (preview only)](2-1-3-source-sector-MEDIUM_COMBUSTION_PLANT.md)
- [specified generator](2-1-3-source-sector-GENERIC.md)
- [other](2-1-3-source-sector-GENERIC.md)

#### Source characteristics

Use the source characteristics panel to enter information about the emission source, such as the height and temperature.

You can choose to input either the temperature or the density of the emissions, or it can be assumed they match ambient conditions.

#### Additional characteristics

Below the source characteristics panel will be additional panels that are relevant to the chosen emission source. When large combustion plant, specified generator or other is selected, emissions must be input manually in kilograms per year.
