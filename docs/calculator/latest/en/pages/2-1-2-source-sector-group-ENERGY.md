## Emission Source: Energy

#### Source characteristics

Use the source characteristics panel to enter information about the emission source, such as the height and temperature.

You can choose to input either the temperature or the density of the emissions, or it can be assumed they match ambient conditions.

#### Additional characteristics

Below the source characteristics panel will be additional panels that are relevant to the chosen emission source. For some emission sources, there are no default emission factors available. For these sources, emissions rates of NOx and NH3 must be input manually in kilograms per year (Kg/y).
