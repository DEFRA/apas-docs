### Distribution

You can use this tab to view the calculation results:
- units of concentration (Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup>) for NO<sub>x</sub> or NH<sub>3</sub>
- units of deposition (kg N /ha/y) for nitrogen

You can use this tab to compare the process contribution (PC), scenario contribution (SC) or the In-combination Process Contribution (IPC) to the concentration or deposition of the most sensitive habitat feature associated with each site.

Results for each designated site are colour-coded on the map and summarised in a bar graph. Clicking on one or more colours on the bar graph will select and deselect the same colours on the map, making it easier to focus on specific result values and to distinguish between similar colours on the map.

The total predicted environmental concentration or deposition level is also shown for each hexagon or point, by adding the PC, SC or IPC to the background pollution levels. The colour of the hexagon corresponds to the concentration or depostion. For the key, please refer to the map layer and click  'calculation results.' The colours, and hence the key change whether you are viewing PC, SC or IPC.
