# Distribution

See the [results](5-results.md) page of the guide for an overview of the results tab.

Results for each designated site are colour-coded on the map and summarised in a bar graph. Clicking on one or more colours on the bar graph will select and deselect the same colours on the map, making it easier to focus on specific result values and to distinguish between similar colours on the map.

For the key, please refer to the map layer and click  'calculation results.' The colours, and hence the key change whether you are viewing PC, SC or IPC.
