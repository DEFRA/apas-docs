## Distribution

You can use this tab to view the calculation results. The drop down menu allows you to navigate to the correct set of results from the following options:
- **Scenario** - Choose between the different scenarios within your calculation job 
- **Result** - this includes whether you want to view the following:
  
  - Scenario contribution (SC) - which shows results for all of the scenarios that were included in the calculation
  - Process contribution (PC) - which shows the pollutant contribution associated only with the proposed project (i.e. without the background levels, reference scenario or off-site reductions)
  - In-combination Process Contribution (IPC) - which shows the PC results including the in-combination results used in the model
  
- **Pollutant** - chose between the relevant pollutants modedlled in your scenario. This will also change the units, depending on what has been modelled including:
      - units of concentration (Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup>) for NO<sub>x</sub> or NH<sub>3</sub>
      - units of deposition (kg N /ha/y) for nitrogen
- **View** - this allows you to change between viewing the results from a fixed assessment grid and the results from the custom assessment points. 

Results for each designated site are colour-coded on the map and summarised in a bar graph. Clicking on one or more colours on the bar graph will select and deselect the same colours on the map, making it easier to focus on specific result values and to distinguish between similar colours on the map.

The total predicted environmental concentration or deposition level is also shown for each hexagon or point, by adding the PC, SC or IPC to the background pollution levels. The colour of the hexagon corresponds to the concentration or depostion. For the key, please refer to the map layer and click  'calculation results.' The colours, and hence the key change whether you are viewing PC, SC or IPC.
