# Monthly Time-varying profiles

Every emission source has an associated time-varying profile. The monthly profile describes how the emissions from a source vary over the course of a year (split into 12 months). Continuous monthly profiles are assigned to each new emission source by default.

There are two ways to create a new custom monthly time-varying profile:
1. The 'Table' option allows you to enter values (known as 'monthly factors') for specific months of the year.
2. The 'Raw input' option allows you to provide the same information, by copying and pasting information from a comma-separated values (.csv) file or a table in an Excel (.xls or .xlsx) file. 

When using either option, the total monthly factors must equal 12, to match the number of months in a year.

For further information about how time-varying profiles have been implemented in the service, please refer to the section on .fac files in the [ADMS Urban user guide](https://www.cerc.co.uk/environmental-software/assets/data/doc_userguides/CERC_ADMS-Urban5.0_User_Guide.pdf) (section 4.1.1 of the guide).
