# About the ‘Get an air pollution assessment’ In-combination Archive

The ’Get an air pollution assessment’ service, known as UK Air Pollution Assessment Service (UK APAS), during its development. 

The In-combination Archive is only accessible to approved regulators to upload the appropriate proposals. It facilitates cumulative and “in-combination” assessments across all key emission source types (agriculture, industry, roads) and stores development records in the In -combination Archive. This streamlined aims to process reduces delays, costs and improves decision making. 

Ultimately, the service provides better protection for nature by making information on habitats, their vulnerability and local emission levels clearer and more accessible.
