# About the ‘Get an air pollution assessment’ in-combination archive

The ’Get an air pollution assessment’ service, which was known as UK Air Pollution Assessment Service (UK APAS) during its development, includes a database referred to as the in-combination archive. This archive facilitates cumulative and "in-combination" assessments across all key emission source types by storing development records to be used by the calculator. This aims to streamline the in-combination assessment procress, reduce delays and costs, and improve decision-making. 

Ultimately, the service provides better protection for nature by making information on habitats, their vulnerability and local emission levels clearer and more accessible. 

The in-combination archive is only accessible to approved regulators to upload and update project proposals.
