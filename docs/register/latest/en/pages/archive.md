# Archive

[[toc]]

The columns of the table contain information about the projects:
* **Upload date** - indicates when the project was added to the archive.
* **Project or plan name** - the name of the project.
* **Project or plan status** - whether the project has been approved or is pending a decision.
* **Project or plan locaton** - England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
* **Regulatory body** - the organisation that added the project to the archive. In the case of planning applications, the regulatory body will most likely be the local planning authority that the application was submitted to. For other applications, this could be the Environment Agency, Defra, Natural England, the devolved administrations or others.
* **Project or plan type** - specifies the main type of activity associated with the project. The options are: agriculture, energy, road transport, industry, or other.
* **In-combination distance** - the area within which the in-combination impacts of the project should be considered for any new applications.
* **Operational year of project or plan** - the year used for the assessment of the impacts of the project.
* **Use in IC assessments** - whether a project should be included or excluded from an in-combination assessment. In most cases, a project should display a checkmark to indicate that it should be included in an in-combination assessment. However, there may be specific cases where a regulatory body makes a decision to exclude a project from in-combination assessments. For example, there may be cases where a project has been approved by regulators but then construction on the project is stalled indefinitely. In this case, the regulatory body may consider it unlikley that the project will ever become operational and they may wish to exclude it from future in-combination assessments.
* **Permit reference** - if relevant, the environmental permit reference number.
* **Planning reference** - if relevant, the planning application reference number.

The Air Pollution Assessment Service will include projects from the archive in an in-combination assessment if all of the following conditions are met:
* The project in the archive is physically located in proximity to a plan or project that is going through the assessment process, i.e. the distance between the archive project and the project undergoing the in-combination assessment is less than the in-combination distance of the archive project.
* The project in the archive is not yet fully operational, i.e. the year by which the archive project would be considered to be included in the background pollutant maps has not yet passed.
* The project in the archive has not been explicitly excluded from in-combination assessments, i.e. it displays a checkmark in the final column of the table.

Clicking on the 'Filters' checkbox will display filter options for each column of the table. Using the filters will limit the projects displayed in the table based on the filter criteria. These can be reset by clicking on 'Reset filters'.

You can sort the projects in the table by clicking on the column headings.
